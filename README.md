# Pt-waterMLP
The repository for my MSc Digital Chemistry research project: Machine learning potentials for aqueous systems and solid-liquid interfaces.

The repository contains 3 folders. The bulk-water folder contains the 5 steps from running the AIMD to validating the model for the bulk water system, and the pt-water folder contains the same for the PT-water system.

In both of these folders there is no step1 folder, as that corresponds to the step of running the AIMD calculation and the orginal ones contain all the AIMD data. The sharing of the AIMD data will be considered on a case-by-case basis thus were not made public. The step2 folder is the QbC step, and step3 folder is the training of the model. step4 and step5 are running MD using MLPs and the validation of the results respectively.

The analysis folder contains jupyter notebooks for the analysis of the data, including the plotting of the graphs presented in the report. Again, the MD data themselves were not shared.
